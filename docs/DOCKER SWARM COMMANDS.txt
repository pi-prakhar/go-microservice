DOCKER SWARM COMMANDS:
## To user docker swarm write a swarm.yml file for the current project.

initialize -> docker swarm init // save the token hash to use later for adding extra worker node or manager node
to get token again -> docker swarm join-token work
		   -> docker swarm join-token manager

start services -> docker stack deploy -c swarm.yml <give name to your swarm>

view all running service -> docker service ls

SCALE SERVICES:
scale services -> docker service scale <service_name>=3

UPDATING SERVICES: 
update image -> docker build -f <dockerfile_name> -t <username/imagename:new-imagetag> .
push to hub -> docker push <username/imagename:new-imagetag> 

##Now before updating the service scale the service to 2 because it gets updated one by one which will
##result into zero downtime.

scale service -> docker service scale <service_name>=2
update service -> docker service update --image <username/imagename:new-imagetag> <service_name>


STOPPING DOCKER SWARM:

scaling service to zero -> docker service scale <service_name>=0
removing the whole swarm -> docker stack rm <swarm_name>
leaving the swarm -> docker swarm leave --force
